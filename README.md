# WEB322 Learning and Assignments
This repository contains all the WEB322 (Web Programming Tools and Frameworks) assignments that I have done as a student at Seneca College. This repo also contains some of the notes and the learning material that I used.

Please don't just copy the code mindlessly without trying to solve the problems yourself, it's totally pointless if you actually wanna learn how to write software and a blatant violation of the [Academic Integrity](https://www.senecacollege.ca/about/policies/academic-integrity-policy.html) policy of the course.
